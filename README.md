# CMMN-MODELS-HAND-DRAWN-SKETCH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM
Abstract
The nature of early requirements activities requires a more flexible approach to
modeling than is provided with traditional modeling tools. A variety of modeling
tools exist to capture of business process models in a structured form. Despite their
advantages, such tools are unnatural for the human user, and are not used in early
stages of modeling and development. In comparison, more flexible approaches such
as office tools or whiteboards are more common in the early stage of system
modeling, as well as more natural for the human user. However, these informal tools
give the user flexibility and freedom, at the expense of consistency management,
change management and model interchange.
Because neither flexible approaches nor traditional modeling tools are ideal, in this
thesis we propose a new intermediate approach in order to reduce the gap between
these two approaches. We propose a tool that can recognize early hand sketches of
CMMN models and transform them into a format that can be imported into a formal
tool. In our approach, we use shape recognition and pattern matching to recognize
freehand drawings of CMMN models and translate them into formal CMMN models.
Next, these formal models are serialized into an XML file that is compliant with the
CMMN model interchange format and can then be imported into CMMN-compliant
tools. The effectiveness of our approach has been tested on more than 500 drawings.
The results confirmed the effectiveness of our approach.
